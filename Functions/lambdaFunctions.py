"""
A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
"""

#syntax
#  lambda arguments : expression

x = lambda a : a + 10
print(x(5))

x = lambda a, b : a * b
print(x(5, 6))

x = lambda a, b, c : a + b + c
print(x(5, 6, 2))

"""
Why Use Lambda Functions?
The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.

Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown number:
"""
def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n
